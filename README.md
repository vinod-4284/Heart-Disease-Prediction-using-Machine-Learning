# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
The Heart Disease Prediction project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict heart disease risk based on health data like age and cholesterol. The model is integrated into a Flask app where users input their details, and the risk prediction is displayed. Additional features like user authentication and report downloads can enhance the system.
